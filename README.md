# Mel\[\*] search code
\* shortened to that from "Melody motion"

My notation code to search for a piece of music using the motion of notes in its melody.

 - Do v1.
 - 2018: @Magnogen and I think this \[search code] is going to be good.

## New users introduction *(to GitHub and its v.c.system)*
<https://docs.github.com/>

\[updated in April 2019]

New users, it's simple to get started - you could:
 - edit a file in this repository - click the edit button and change  
 some code in the Github text editor or paste a new version there
 - upload file(s) or create a new one, using the editor
 - give suggestions or help with fixing bugs in  
 the Issues area (a tab at the top of this page)
 - read all of this section.

If you haven't been given collaborator access, you need to  
*create a new branch for your commit(s) and start a pull request*.

Describing your changes is a good idea that helps people understand what you changed \- the  
version control system managing these edits (used by Github under its Graphical User Interface)  
saves this information, including who did the edit and when it was done.

The first time you create/upload your file(s), they get added to a special copy (fork) of the main repository, in  
a new branch, where "new ideas can be safely tested" without changing the original files (master branch).

Also, a pull request is automatically created for you, a place to suggest changes and review them  
with other people. All the things you changed (adding/deleting text) can be seen here, shown with a file  
comparison tool called a diff. This helps the repository owner / collaborators to check your work, discuss  
any problems, add their own edits then merge the changes (adding them to the main "master" branch).
  
You can fork this repository to create another version, on your user account.  
Learn more on the help pages (keywords: the glossary), information about version control can be found in a Wikipedia article.
